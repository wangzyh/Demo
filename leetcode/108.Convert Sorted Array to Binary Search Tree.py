# Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a h
# eight balanced BST. 
# 
#  For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree i
# n which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
#  
# 
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
# 
# One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following he
# ight balanced BST:
# 
#       0
#      / \
#    -3   9
#    /   /
#  -10  5
