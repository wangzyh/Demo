# 
# Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the 
# top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Meda
# l" and "Bronze Medal". 
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  
# Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
# Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so the
# y got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". For the left two athletes
# , you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
#  
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000. 
#  All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
