# A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the
#  6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). 
#  Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the righ
# t. 
# 
#  For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25". 
# 
#  Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are c
# urrently on, return all possible times the watch could represent. 
# 
#  Example:
#  Input: n = 1 Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04",
#  "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"] 
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  The order of output does not matter. 
#  The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, i
# t should be "1:00". 
#  The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for 
# example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".
