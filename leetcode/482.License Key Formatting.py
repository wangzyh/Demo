# You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alph
# anumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dash
# es. 
# 
#  Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group 
# contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter
#  than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must 
# be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be conver
# ted to uppercase. 
# 
#  Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the
#  rules described above. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
#  
# Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
# 
# Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
# 
# Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 chara
# cters.
# Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
#  
#  
# 
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
# Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
# 
# Output: "2-5G-3J"
# 
# Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 cha
# racters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
#  
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer. 
#  String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-
# 9) and dashes(-). 
#  String S is non-empty.
