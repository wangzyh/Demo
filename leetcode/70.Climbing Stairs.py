# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. 
# 
#  Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can yo
# u climb to the top? 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 45
